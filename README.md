# Fitegy - A Social Fitness App

## What and why?

What: An app where users can choose or create their own workout challenges and they can send their challenges to their friends! After they complete the challenges, they can click workout complete and confirm. Once you and your friends have done the workout together, you can collect points for different sets of challenges and share the challenges to a timeline where you can see what your friends have done too. Users can later pick up these challenges by their friends by either completing with them, with themnselves, or with other people! Points can be redeemed for prizes and gears by collabaration with fitness coaches, gyms, workout gym companies, etc. If we really go that far, large events such as marathons for cancer or mental health challenges can be hosted and expanded on our platform too. 

Why: I want to transform this hobby of mine into a social network where people can feel motivated since we love working out with peopole. A lot of people struggle to keep a consistent routine of exercising, and we all know that humans are highly social animals. We see what our friends are doing, and we want to do that too. Personally, I have tried to bring my friends to gym with me but it always failed eventually. It was always a one-time thing. If we can create a type of social platform where people constantly see the effort their friends are taking to better their health and physique, I believe that the incentive is huge and people would feel more inclined to maintain a consistent habit. In addition, it can be intimidating for beginners in places such as gyms, and I know for me and for others, it's always more comforting if you bring a friend with you. The core idea is that, we are social animals. So when we see somebody doing a challenge themselves or with other people, we would be more intrigued to know “if we can do that too”.

## For whom? 

For people who have workout habits, who enjoy exercising with people rather than alone, who are more motivated and love accepting challenges, or somebody who is a beginner and prefers starting a new habit with someone. I can imagine this software would be more targeted towards younger generations, but all ages and occupations are welcomed. 

## How? 

1. Users can register their profiles on the app. 
2. Users can accept challenges by other people, create challenges for themselves, and send challenges to their friends. 
3. Once challenges are completed, users can earn points. 
4. Users can share their challenge status on the timeline on our app, or to their own social media too. (Completed, or in progress)
5. Users can see what challenges their friends are currently taking and send requests to join them or take on the challenges themselves, or challenge others too. 
6. Points can be redeemed for free stuff, gears, gym membership trais, premium features, exlusive fitness content. 
7. Users can join events at a large scale such as 100 burpees in 10 mins collectively across the whole app, or public events like marathons for breast cancer and challenge their friends to do it with them. Such events can be hosted and promoted on our platform. 
8. Users can even send challenge invites to non-users, and thus they would feel more intrigued to accept the challenges. A example can be "I challenge to run 3k around Central Park with me". Users then can download the app and try out. 

## Scope
In terms of creating the databases, sign up system, web interfaces or just the app itself, would be feasible as a group project in this courses. However, in terms of collaboratiion with gyms, fitness coaches, gear companies, or accepting advertisements would be too ambitious at this point and can be only accomplished once we have enough users.
